# Crypto Dashboard
| React Native| Redux|
|--|--|

> code for Crypto Dashboard can be found in a separate repository at [crypto-dashboard](https://github.com/dillon/crypto-dashboard)

A React Native mobile app that displays market info and news on the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market cap.

Each cryptocurrency can be clicked to view more price-related and technical information such as its available, total, and maximum supply.

This app uses React Native and Redux to store each coin's information from CoinMarketCap and news from CryptoPanic.

I used [this guide](https://medium.com/react-native-training/tutorial-react-native-redux-native-mobile-app-for-tracking-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-litecoin-810850cf8acc) by Indrek Lasn to help set up react-redux as a single-page app with a list of cryptocurrencies and then added multi-page navigation and an action to fetch news to the redux store when a coin's page is visited.
